Objective
In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.

Task
Given an integer, , print its first  multiples. Each multiple  (where ) should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

Input Format

A single integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print  lines of output; each line  (where ) contains the  of  in the form:
N x i = result.


import java.util.Scanner;



public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
        for (int i=1; i<=10; i++){
            System.out.println(n+" x "+i+" = " +n*i);
        }
    }
}
